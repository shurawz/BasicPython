REMEMBER: Default value of the sticky is always 'centre'.

Line 13 should bring the 'Tkinter Grid Demo' in the middle but it doesn't do that until weight of the column isnot set to 1.

I used 'LabelFrame' in line 37. It is very similar to Frame but we can add framename as i did in line 37 with text="File Details".
